## üöÄ My Journey: Building a Hybrid Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Jenkins & AWS

Welcome to my personal journey of creating a robust hybrid continuous delivery pipeline that combines the power of Jenkins with AWS cloud services. In this project, I'll walk you through every step of my setup, from initial planning to a fully automated deployment pipeline.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Prerequisites Required

**Before diving into this hybrid project, I strongly recommend you first explore my two foundational projects:**

1. **"Continuous Delivery with JENKINS & Tools"** - My comprehensive guide to Jenkins CI/CD setup and pipeline automation
2. **"Continuous Delivery on AWS"** - My deep dive into AWS-native continuous delivery solutions

**üîó Please visit my GitHub repository to access these prerequisite projects first.** Understanding these foundational concepts is essential for successfully following along with this hybrid Jenkins-AWS setup. These projects contain the building blocks and core concepts that I'll be combining and extending in this hybrid approach.

## üìã What I'm Building

I'm creating a comprehensive continuous delivery solution that leverages:
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD orchestration and pipeline management
- **AWS Services** for cloud infrastructure and deployment targets
- **Hybrid Architecture** combining on-premises and cloud resources
- **Infrastructure as Code** for reproducible deployments
- **Containerization** for consistent application packaging

## üéØ My Goals

Through this project, I aim to:
- ‚úÖ Master hybrid cloud deployment strategies
- ‚úÖ Automate the entire software delivery lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Create scalable and maintainable infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Learn best practices for Jenkins-AWS integration
- ‚úÖ Build a portfolio-worthy CI/CD solution

## üèóÔ∏è My Architecture Overview

[Image placeholder: Architecture diagram showing Jenkins, AWS services, and hybrid setup]

## üóÑÔ∏è My Database Setup: Amazon RDS MySQL

I've successfully set up my database infrastructure using Amazon RDS:

### Database Configuration
- **Database Name**: `vprofile-hybrid-mysql`
- **Engine**: MySQL Community
- **Instance Size**: db.t2.micro
- **Master Username**: `admin`
- **Master Password**: `[SECURED - Stored in AWS Parameter Store]`

### Important Security Notes
- I received the master password only once during creation
- I've securely stored the credentials for future reference
- I'll need to modify the database if I forget the password

### Setup Process
1. I created the database through AWS RDS console
2. I configured the necessary security groups for database access
3. ‚úÖ I initialized the database with required schemas
4. I updated security groups to allow Jenkins and application connections

## üå± My Application Hosting: AWS Elastic Beanstalk

I've set up my application hosting infrastructure using AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

### Application Configuration
- **Application Name**: `vprofile-hybrid-app`
- **Project Tag**: `cicd-hybrid`
- **Platform**: Tomcat 8.5 with Corretto 11 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2
- **Platform Version**: 4.1.1 (Recommended)

### Environment Configuration
- **Environment Type**: Load balanced
- **Auto Scaling**: 
  - Minimum instances: 1
  - Maximum instances: 4
- **Fleet Composition**: On-Demand instances
- **Initial Setup**: Used sample application for testing

### Setup Process
1. I created the application with proper naming and tagging
2. I configured the Tomcat platform for Java application hosting
3. I set up load balancing and auto-scaling parameters
4. I configured the environment for optimal performance

## üîí My Security Group Configuration

I've configured security groups to ensure secure communication between my application and database:

### RDS Security Group Configuration

**Inbound Rule Configuration:**
- **Type**: MYSQL/Aurora
- **Protocol**: TCP
- **Port Range**: 3306 (MySQL default port)
- **Source**: Security Group (BeanStalk Instance)
- **Description**: "Allow 3306 from BeanStalk Instance"

### Security Best Practices Implemented
- I restricted database access to only my application instances
- I used security group references instead of open IP ranges
- I configured specific port access for MySQL connections
- I documented all security group rules for future reference
